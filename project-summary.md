#Title: Differences in gene expressions between fetus and adults brains

## Summary
In this genomic data science project, we are evaluating differences in gene expression between fetal and adult brains. Transcriptome sequencing data (known as RNA-seq) for this genomic data science project was sequenced on an Illumina platform from human post-mortem brains. The raw sequencing data and meta-data related to each brain sample has been downloaded from a public database. The data will be aligned, quality control performed on the alignments, and gene count levels of expression will be determined. With the aid of exploratory and fitting statistical models,  patterns of gene expression will be identified between fetus and adult brains. Findings from this genomic data science project will provide insights in to genes differentially expressed between fetus and adult brains, and will be an example of reproducible research in genomic sciences.
